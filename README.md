# Communicating Statistics

This is the github repo for related projects from Communicating Statistics course by Professor Andrew Gelman.

# Motivation

Why communicating with statistics? Communication is central to your job as a quantitative researcher. Our goal in this course is for you to improve at all aspects of statistical communication, including writing, public speaking, teaching, informal conversation and collaboration, programming, and graphics.

# Contents

The following are selected contents that I found useful to collect for this course and for future generations.

## Graphing Data

The ability to graph succinct data with no more or less notation is crucial in this area. You want to be able to create a graph that any audience can immediately capture exactly what you are trying to say. A good article addressing this point is [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2012/12/06/one-more-graphics-principle-for-stephen-kosslyn-theres-no-need-to-cram-everything-into-a-single-plot/).

## Communicating Error

What happens when you are dealing with errors, variability, and uncertainty? Howard Wainer pointed out a few points in displaying errors can be helpful [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/communication/Wainer1996.pdf/). Professor Gelman also disclosed a few ideas in his blog which are listed in the following:

- [Kahan](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2014/11/25/almost-inadvertently-followed-dan-kahans-principles-class-today/)
- Detailed discussion about variation and uncertainty is the key to discuss what could go wrong in an analysis, which is essential in making business decisions since "what-if" scenarios are definitely required to be discussed on the table. A good source is [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/bayes_management.pdf).

## Giving Presentations

Among all communication skills, giving good presentations is one of the most important ones. The ability to not just spread information but also deliver information in a succinct and quantitative manner can be quite challenging. Fortunately, Professor Gelman provided this source [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2014/12/01/quick-tips-giving-research-presentations/). Another professor also provided some detailed experience in the same arena, click [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/communication/Wainer2009.pdf).

Additionally, the ability to encourage your audience to engage to your topic can be another challenging skill. A good source discussing this ability is [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2009/04/21/w_bradford_pale/).

## Dynamic Graphics

Dynamic graphics for data, means simulating motion or movement using the computer. It may also be thought of as multiple plots linked by time. Two main examples of dynamic graphics are animations, and tours. An animation, very generally defined, may be produced for time-indexed data by showing the plots in time order, for example as generated by an optimization algorithm.

## Collaboration and Consulting

A good statistician in industry share quite a few similarities with being a good consultant. I think it is crucial to understand this and a good source can be [Rindskopfâ€™s Rules for Statistical Consulting](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2008/01/25/rindskopfs_rule/). Moreover, we also want to get a bit of understanding of the expectation of being a good consultant which is discussed by [this article](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2012/11/29/what-is-expected-of-a-consultant/).
