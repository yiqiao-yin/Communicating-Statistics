# Communicating Statistics

This is the github repo for related projects from Communicating Statistics course by Professor Andrew Gelman. Github.io page is [here](https://yiqiao-yin.github.io/Communicating-Statistics.github.io/).

# Motivation

Why communicating with statistics? Communication is central to your job as a quantitative researcher. Our goal in this course is for you to improve at all aspects of statistical communication, including writing, public speaking, teaching, informal conversation and collaboration, programming, and graphics.

# Contents

The following are selected contents that I found useful to collect for this course and for future generations.

## Story Telling

The course starts with a simple topic: story telling. We discussed students' work and research experience in groups which revolved with kaiser Fung's [article](https://junkcharts.typepad.com/numbersruleyourworld/2011/11/three-hours-in-the-life-of-a-glorified-data-scientist.html) about data scientists. Recommended books are [here](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/andrew-gelman-on-statistics/).

## Graphing Data

The ability to graph succinct data with no more or less notation is crucial in this area. You want to be able to create a graph that any audience can immediately capture exactly what you are trying to say. A good article addressing this point is [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2012/12/06/one-more-graphics-principle-for-stephen-kosslyn-theres-no-need-to-cram-everything-into-a-single-plot/). Professor Gelman and Professor Unwin also wrote an amazing [article](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/vis14.pdf) discussing infoviz and statistical graphics which deserves our attention.

## Principles of Graphics

With graphing data laying the group work, we move on to generalized principles of graphics in this session with Zigerall's reading on [plot](https://www.ljzigerell.com/?p=1891) and [confidence interval](https://www.ljzigerell.com/?p=1916). We also discussed the revolution of statistical graphics over time and how audience changes focus in interpreting graphics. An [article](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/communication/Wainer2009.pdf) here by Wainer brought up a few interesting points.

## Classroom Teaching

I have never been a professor. I have only being a TA for one class before. I found teaching fascinating though I felt there is plenty of room for me to improve. This topic is particularly helpful for me. Here are some quick [pro tipes](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2014/08/18/quick-disorganzed-tips-classroom-teaching/) by Professor Gelman. Another [article](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2009/08/06/how_to_design_a/) by him specifically on statistical inference is quite interesint as well.

## Communicating Error

What happens when you are dealing with errors, variability, and uncertainty? Howard Wainer pointed out a few points in displaying errors can be helpful [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/communication/Wainer1996.pdf/). Professor Gelman also disclosed a few ideas in his blog which are listed in the following:

- [Kahan](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2014/11/25/almost-inadvertently-followed-dan-kahans-principles-class-today/)
- Detailed discussion about variation and uncertainty is the key to discuss what could go wrong in an analysis, which is essential in making business decisions since "what-if" scenarios are definitely required to be discussed on the table. A good source is [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/bayes_management.pdf).

## Giving Presentations

Among all communication skills, giving good presentations is one of the most important ones. The ability to not just spread information but also deliver information in a succinct and quantitative manner can be quite challenging. Fortunately, Professor Gelman provided this source [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2014/12/01/quick-tips-giving-research-presentations/). Another professor also provided some detailed experience in the same arena, click [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/communication/Wainer2009.pdf).

Additionally, the ability to encourage your audience to engage to your topic can be another challenging skill. A good source discussing this ability is [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2009/04/21/w_bradford_pale/).

## Dynamic Graphics

Dynamic graphics for data, means simulating motion or movement using the computer. It may also be thought of as multiple plots linked by time. Two main examples of dynamic graphics are animations, and tours. An animation, very generally defined, may be produced for time-indexed data by showing the plots in time order, for example as generated by an optimization algorithm.

A good source can refer to [here](http://download.gsb.bund.de/BIB/global_flow/).

## Collaboration and Consulting

A good statistician in industry share quite a few similarities with being a good consultant. I think it is crucial to understand this and a good source can be [Rindskopfâ€™s Rules for Statistical Consulting](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2008/01/25/rindskopfs_rule/). Moreover, we also want to get a bit of understanding of the expectation of being a good consultant which is discussed by [this article](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2012/11/29/what-is-expected-of-a-consultant/).

## Communication and Impact on Science

It is often times that successful results come easy on paper. However, truly replicable performance will not be so easy and it always require much more serious connection among theory, measurement, and data. Professor Gelman had a very good article [here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/incrementalism_3.pdf) discussing this idea. 

A good source of discussing Type M and Type S errors can be [here](https://alexanderetz.com/2015/05/21/type-s-and-type-m-errors/).

## Project

For project wrapping up Communicating Statistics class session this term, I decided to present some of my findings during the past few years of my research about a potential problem in financial market. To tackle this problem, I present my solution as well as my experiencing in running my own fund, [Yin's Capital](https://yinscapital.com/). Please see the project page by clicking [here](https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/Communicating-Statistics/tree/master/Project). 

This presentation has the following structure:

- *Introduction*: what are we doing here today? what is the audience?

- *Background and Motivation*: what is the current situation? what is potential consequence?

- *Proposed Solution*: some new directions need to be taken: timing is one technology in high demand but not in application right now; I propose a technology that times stock market in any market environment.

- *Conclusion*

I will finish up with time for questions. I do not think this is a one-man job. If anybody can raise questions, that's automatically a learning opportunity for me and that is where this presentation will land on, to incentivize audience to think and to ask questions so in long run these thoughts today can impact our future tomorrow.
